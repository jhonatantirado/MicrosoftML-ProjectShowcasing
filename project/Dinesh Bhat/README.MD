## Introduction :

Most of companies incidents are routed manually to respective team using Incident Routing system (IMS). This may get delayed or not routed to appropriate team based on understanding of the incident. So, this could get into not meeting the SLA or not addressing the incident appropriately.Hence company would like to implement automated incident routing system using Machine learning to avoid such scenarios.
