Project Name : Predict the productivity of an Outlet

Summary of Project:
As we know field work professional go to different outlets to conduct survey about new product launch
and they take interview of people. Here Productivity means if a field work professional goes to particular 
Outlet how many interview he was able to take. For example if two FWP goes to One outlet and conduct 50 interview then productivity
of that outlet will be No of Interview / No of man days invested. So 50/2= 25 will be the productivity.

Here in this use case challenge is that based on historical data we have to predict the productivity of 
an Outlet.

In this i will be using a very unique technique to do regression which is NGBoost.
Why I am using this because its give output as a whole distribution not a point prediction. What I
mean by whole distribution is that it will give you a range sort of.
