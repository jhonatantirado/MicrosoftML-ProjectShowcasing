## PROJECT NAME:
Classify The right Customer


**PROJECT DONE BY** : Sayed Ahmed

  
  

**ABOUT:**

In this project I have worked with a particular dataset. The problem is to detect discrete values or classes or a potential customer. I have used different classification algorithms to solve the problem. The code for each algorithm is added to this repository. I have compared the results of multiple classifiers and opted the best ones for this problem. 

  

**USED LIBRARIES AND IMPLEMENTED KNOWLEDGE:**

  

1.	Pandas
2.	Matplotlib
3.	Sickit learn

implemented Knowledge from course work
1.	Scaling data
2.	Reducing overfitting, underfitting
3.	Data preprocessing
4.	Ensemble Algorithm
5.	Model Evaluation, Confusion Matrixes 
6.	Plotting predicted result
7.	Dimensionality reduction

  
  

**DATASET**

![DatasetImage](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1zi2AFR7LRqStksvi8JQkuLzhIkG8ENHF)


The dataset contains user purchase history of a certain product along with user information. From the dataset I have trained a model that can detect potential customer.

The dataset contains userId, Gender, Age, Estimated Salary, Car Purchase column, We can see that Age and estimated salary will have influence on users purchasing decision. To reduce dimensionality, Iâ€™m excluding other variables except for Age and Estimated salary, so these variables are independent variables and purchase column is dependent variable and that what we want to predict.

I have tried different classification algorithms to predict and compare them to find the best model for this problem.

The algorithm I have trained using this dataset are
1.	Logistic regression
2.	KNN classifier
3.	SVM classifier
4.	Decision tree classifier
5.	Random Forest classifier

I have included Confusion matrix and plot of both training and test result, so that the performance of the model could be understood properly.
