# Hands dirty - a beginner walkthrough of the course concepts with implementation

## Short description of the project

In this showcase project my goal is to apply the whole course from concepts through preparing the data and up to evaluating model performance.
I want to focus this project on knowledge and show how this whole process can be implemented with a dataset. My purpose is really to explain clearly each concept and associate the implementation.
As I dont have a lot of time - I'm a working mom ;) - I will focus on a supervised two-class classification using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. If I still have time I will do the same with a supervised regression problem.

## Team

**Slack name :** CÃ©cile N. => I'm alone on this one

## Who this project is for ?

This project is aimed to help beginners like me to have in one project the synthetic visualization of the concepts, the process and an implementation of this.

## Used technologies

- Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda 3)
- GitHub Desktop
- Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic)


## First implementation - Titanic
### Data used

The data I used for this first implementation are the [data on the Titanic from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

### Steps

- [Analyse the type of problem you are facing](https://github.com/NAVERGONI/MicrosoftML-ProjectShowcasing/blob/master/project/C%C3%A9cile%20N/AnalyzeTheProblem.ipynb)

- [Explore and prepare your data](https://github.com/NAVERGONI/MicrosoftML-ProjectShowcasing/blob/master/project/C%C3%A9cile%20N/ExploreAndPrepareYourData.ipynb)

   
## References
   
  
Aside the references that I have cited in the Notebooks I borowed a lot of material from the **UDACITY - Microsoft Azure ML Scholarship course**


## Project extensions
  
  - Improve the results using:
    
    - Feature engineering
      
    - Feature selection
    
    - Cross-validation
      
    - Hyperparameters tuning
    
  - A second implementation with a linear regression problem (e.g.: [House prices on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data))
  
  - Implement the same pipeline but this time with Python embeded in the Jupyter Notebook instead of the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio
