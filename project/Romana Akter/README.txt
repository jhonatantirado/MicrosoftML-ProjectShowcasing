## Project: Data Exploration and Visualization Practice on Bike Rental Dataset
### Slack Name: Romana Akter
#### Project Description
I worked on the bike rental demand prediction dataset from Engineer and Select Features lab of the foundation course. I mainly focused on the EDA and Visualization of the dataset.

EDA is one of the crucial step in data science that allows us to achieve certain insights and statistical measure that is essential for the business continuity, stockholders and data scientists. It performs to define and refine our important features variable selection, that will be used in our model.
Once EDA is complete and insights are drawn, its feature can be used for supervised and unsupervised machine learning modelling.
An ML or AI model can improve significantly if it is pruned and manipulated in the right way.

Data visualization is useful for data cleaning, exploring data structure, detecting outliers and unusual groups, identifying trends and clusters, spotting local patterns, evaluating modeling output, and presenting results. It is essential for exploratory data analysis.
