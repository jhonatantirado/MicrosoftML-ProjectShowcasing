In this project, i scraped the comments and posts available on social sites like Facebook and some famous bengali blog like somewherein blog, priyo.com etc. I modified the raw data using NumPy and Pandas. The dataset contains label(sentiment) and text. I have used three class for sentiment analysis: **Angry, Sad and Happy**. From this dataset I have trained a model that can detect the sentiment of text if it is angry, sad or happy.

Since this is a sentiment analysis project, I only used a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier as is standard for text-based data science projects.

I have attached images of code and output of Confusion matrix and plot of both training and test result, so that the performance of the model could be understood properly. 

Accuracy is 70%.
